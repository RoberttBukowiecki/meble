# Image Prompts for Meble Landing Page

This document contains prompts for generating new images for the Meble landing page. The goal is to create a modern, abstract, and clean aesthetic that fits a software product for furniture design.

## Hero Image

-   **File:** `hero-mockup.webp`
-   **Aspect Ratio:** Approximately 1:1.12 (384x340) -> We can use 1:1 for simplicity and a more balanced look.
-   **Prompt:** "A 3D abstract render of floating geometric shapes and planes, in a minimalist style. The shapes resemble pieces of furniture (e.g., a flat plane for a tabletop, a cube for a cabinet body). The color palette is muted and sophisticated, with shades of beige, grey, and a single accent color like a deep blue or forest green. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of calm and precision. The background is a light, neutral grey. Aspect ratio 1:1."

## Benefits Section Images

### Benefit 1: Production-ready 3D model

-   **File:** `mockup-1.webp`
-   **Aspect Ratio:** Approximately 1:1
-   **Prompt:** "An abstract 3D visualization of a parametric furniture design. A single piece of wood is being digitally measured and cut with glowing lines of light, showing dimensions and angles. The style is clean, minimalist, and technical. The color palette is light and airy, with white, light grey, and a touch of natural wood texture. The background is a clean white. Aspect ratio 1:1."

### Benefit 2: Materials and edge banding library

-   **File:** `mockup-2.webp`
-   **Aspect Ratio:** Approximately 1:1
-   **Prompt:** "A close-up, abstract 3D render of different material samples. A stack of flat planes, each with a different texture: one with a light wood grain, one with a matte white finish, one with a dark grey laminate. A glowing line highlights the edge of one of the planes, representing the edge banding. The style is hyper-realistic and tactile. The color palette is neutral and focuses on the textures. The background is a soft, out-of-focus grey. Aspect ratio 1:1."

### Benefit 3: Export and quality control

-   **File:** `mockup-1.webp` (reused)
-   **Prompt:** "An abstract 3D representation of data validation. A schematic of a piece of furniture made of glowing lines is shown on a virtual grid. Green checkmarks appear on each joint and panel, symbolizing successful validation. A final, consolidated data sheet with abstract charts and numbers is shown in the foreground. The style is futuristic and data-driven. The color palette consists of dark blue, grey, and glowing green accents. The background is a dark, tech-inspired pattern. Aspect ratio 1:1."

## Testimonial Avatars

Instead of using photos of people, we can use abstract, professional-looking avatars to maintain a consistent brand identity.

-   **Files:** `testimonial-1.webp`, `testimonial-2.webp`, `testimonial-3.webp`
-   **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1
-   **Prompt (for all three):** "A minimalist and abstract avatar. A perfect circle containing a simple, elegant geometric pattern or a stylized monogram. The color palette is a single, solid color from the brand's palette (e.g., deep blue, forest green, or dark grey) on a light grey background. The design is clean, modern, and gender-neutral."
